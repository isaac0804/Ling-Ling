# Ling Ling
 
Ling Ling v1 is a generative deep learning model that involves transformer encoders (Feature Learning) and VQ-VAE (Generative).
Transformer Encoders are trained using DINO Self-Supervised Learning method to learn features in the given dataset. 

## Problem Occur
The representation of notes and patches seems to be very close to each other, causing the model to collapse.
